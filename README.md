## Overview

**What's this?**

BSData organisation created this project. It's GitHub repository of datafiles.
Maintained by community, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe. If you want
to develop - cool! We need you! Take a look at [Getting Started wiki][]

**Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?** _I just want those files..._

Yeah! We have it hosted on AppSpot. Take a look: [BattleScribe Data on Appspot][]

## Notes

**Groups**

The datafiles are cross-compatible with army lists currently published and maintained by NetEA, F-ERC, EpicUK or EpicAU, where applicable. When you create a new roster, you should begin by selecting the community, before adding your units.

**Translations**

You may notice the different languages have rules variations. Each active community has made developments to suit the needs of their group; most of the French translations come from F-ERC and reflect their particular developments. The Spanish, Italian and most especially the German language support is only experimental at this stage.

**Army Lists**

Our Repo describes over 333 factions, forces, chapters & regiments (from the _400 plus_ army lists currently available) as well as incorporating supplementary features like Riot or Minigeddon.

**Release Numbers**

Release Numbers are shown in 4 parts {aa}{bb}{ccc}{ddd}. {aa} is the _gst_ version. {bb} is a simple counter, starting from 00 and incrementing by 1 with each release since the _gst_ was last updated. {ccc} is the number of standard _cat_ files, while {ddd} is the number of forces covered by those _cat_ files. {ccc} & {ddd} are not displayed if they are unchanged since the previous release, and they never include Riot & Insurgency, nor the forces contained within those 2 files.
